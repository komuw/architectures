### architectures

This is a repo that has demo code for some code architecture/design systems.

1. Clean architecture: https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html
2. My/IO: Which is just my little idea. It is a bit like [Functional core imperative shell](https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/screencasts/catalog/functional-core-imperative-shell), except maybe in the reverse.
